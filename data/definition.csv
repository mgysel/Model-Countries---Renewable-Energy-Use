Code,Indicator Name,Long definition
1.2_ACCESS.ELECTRICITY.RURAL,Access to electricity (% of rural population with access),Access to electricity (% of rural population with access): Percentage of rural population with access to electricity
1.1_ACCESS.ELECTRICITY.TOT,Access to electricity (% of total population),Access to electricity (% of total population): Percentage of total population with access to electricity
1.3_ACCESS.ELECTRICITY.URBAN,Access to electricity (% of urban population with access),Access to electricity (% of urban population with access): Percentage of urban population with access to electricity
6.1_PRIMARY.ENERGY.INTENSITY,Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/2011 USD PPP),Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/2011 USD PPP): A ratio between energy supply and gross domestic product measured at purchasing power parity. Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output.
4.1.2_REN.ELECTRICITY.OUTPUT,Renewable electricity output (GWh),"Renewable electricity output (GWh): Electric output (GWh) of power plants using renewable resources, including wind, solar PV, solar thermal, hydro, marine, geothermal, solid biofuels, renewable municipal waste, liquid biofuels and biogas. Electricity production from hydro pumped storage is excluded."
4.1_SHARE.RE.IN.ELECTRICITY,Renewable electricity share of total electricity output (%),Renewable electricity share of total electricity output (%): Electricity generated by power plants using renewable resources as a share of total electricity output.
3.1_RE.CONSUMPTION,Renewable energy consumption (TJ),"Renewable energy consumption (TJ): This indicator includes energy consumption from all renewable resources: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste"
2.1_SHARE.TOTAL.RE.IN.TFEC,Renewable energy share of TFEC (%),Renewable energy share of TFEC (%): Share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption
4.1.1_TOTAL.ELECTRICITY.OUTPUT,Total electricity output (GWh),Total electricity output (GWh): Total number of GWh generated by all power plants
1.1_TOTAL.FINAL.ENERGY.CONSUM,Total final energy consumption (TFEC) (TJ),Total final energy consumption (TFEC): This indicator is derived form energy balances statistics and is equivalent to total final consumption excluding non-energy use
